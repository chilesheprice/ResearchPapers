## ABSTRACT

In the decade since our 2015 review, the landscape of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular disease has undergone a dramatic transformation. The "timing hypothesis" has evolved from a speculative concept to an evidence-based clinical framework, supported by long-term follow-up studies, advanced imaging trials, and comprehensive meta-analyses. Most notably, in November 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed the black box warnings from hormone therapy products, marking a paradigm shift in how we approach menopausal symptom management and cardiovascular risk. This update reviews the accumulating evidence from 2015-2026, examines the scientific basis for the FDA's historic decision, and provides contemporary evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing menopausal women with cardiovascular considerations.

## INTRODUCTION

When we published our initial review in 2015, the medical community remained deeply divided about hormone replacement therapy (HRT, now more commonly termed menopausal hormone therapy or MHT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) results from 2002 had cast a long shadow over hormone therapy, leading to widespread abandonment of MHT for postmenopausal women. However, even then, cracks were appearing in the prevailing narrative. Secondary analyses suggested that age and timing of initiation might fundamentally alter the risk-benefit calculus.

The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress in our understanding of the complex relationship between menopause, hormone therapy, and cardiovascular health. This progress culminated in a landmark decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2025 to remove black box warnings from menopausal hormone therapy products—a decision that reflects the maturation of our scientific understanding and has profound implications for women's health.

In this review, we examine the key developments of the past decade, including:
- Validation and refinement of the timing hypothesis
- Long-term follow-up data from major clinical trials
- Development of risk-stratified approaches to MHT
- The 2020 American Heart Association scientific statement on menopause and CVD
- The FDA's 2025 decision and its scientific rationale
- Contemporary, evidence-based clinical recommendations

## THE EVOLUTION OF THE TIMING HYPOTHESIS (2015-2026)

### From Speculation to Clinical Framework

In 2015, the timing hypothesis was emerging as a potential explanation for the discordance between observational studies showing cardiovascular benefit and randomized trials showing harm. The hypothesis posited that estrogen's cardiovascular effects depend critically on when therapy is initiated relative to menopause onset—beneficial when started early in healthy arteries, potentially harmful when initiated in the presence of established atherosclerosis.

Over the past decade, this hypothesis has been robustly validated through multiple lines of evidence:

#### Long-Term Follow-Up of KEEPS
The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) continuation provided crucial 14-year follow-up data on women who received 4 years of hormone therapy shortly after menopause. While the initial 4-year results showed no significant differences in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression, the long-term follow-up revealed important safety signals: no increase in cardiovascular events, diabetes, or metabolic dysfunction in women who had received early MHT compared to placebo. Notably, there was a trend toward lower diabetes incidence in the hormone therapy groups, though not statistically significant by laboratory measures.

#### Extended WHI Analyses
Extended follow-up of WHI participants, now exceeding 20 years for some cohorts, has further clarified age-stratified outcomes. Women who initiated MHT between ages 50-59 showed:
- Reduced all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.78 for estrogen alone)
- Decreased coronary heart disease incidence compared to placebo
- Lower coronary artery calcium scores on imaging substudies
- No increase in stroke risk in the youngest cohort

In contrast, women initiating therapy 20+ years after menopause showed increased cardiovascular events, reinforcing that timing matters profoundly.

#### Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews
A comprehensive 2022 meta-analysis of over 40,000 women from multiple trials confirmed that MHT initiated within 10 years of menopause or before age 60 reduces coronary heart disease risk (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.90) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95), while later initiation shows neutral to harmful effects.

## THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION'S 2020 SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT

A pivotal moment in the rehabilitation of our understanding came in November 2020, when the American Heart Association (AHA) published a scientific statement titled "Menopause Transition and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Implications for Timing of Early Prevention."

### Key Findings from the AHA Statement

The writing group, led by Dr. Samar El Khoudary, synthesized evidence demonstrating that:

1. **The menopausal transition itself is a period of accelerating CVD risk**, independent of chronological aging
2. **Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are not merely quality-of-life issues** but are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular risk profiles
3. **The menopause transition represents a critical window** for implementing preventive interventions
4. **Age at menopause influences CVD risk**, with earlier menopause conferring higher risk

The statement emphasized that the transition to menopause—not simply the postmenopausal state—is when cardiovascular risk accelerates most dramatically. This reframing highlighted the importance of monitoring women's cardiovascular health during midlife and considering targeted interventions during this critical window.

The AHA statement stopped short of broadly recommending MHT for cardiovascular prevention but acknowledged that for women with significant vasomotor symptoms, MHT remains the most effective treatment and, when initiated appropriately, does not appear to increase cardiovascular risk in younger menopausal women.

## DEVELOPMENT OF RISK-STRATIFIED APPROACHES

The past decade has seen the emergence of sophisticated, individualized approaches to MHT decision-making that move beyond simple age cutoffs to comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment.

### Contemporary Risk Stratification Framework

Modern guidelines now recommend stratifying women into risk categories:

**Low Risk:**
- Age <60 or <10 years since menopause
- No cardiovascular disease or risk factors
- CAC score = 0 (if measured)
- No history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)

**Intermediate Risk:**
- Age <60 or <10 years since menopause
- 1-2 cardiovascular risk factors
- CAC score 1-99 AU
- Low-intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk (<10%)

**High Risk:**
- Age ≥60 or ≥10 years since menopause
- Multiple cardiovascular risk factors
- CAC score 100-400 AU
- 10-year ASCVD risk 10-20%

**Very High Risk (MHT Contraindicated):**
- Established ASCVD (prior MI, stroke, revascularization)
- CAC score >400 AU
- 10-year ASCVD risk >20%
- History of VTE, thrombophilia

### Route and Formulation Considerations

Research over the past decade has clarified important differences in cardiovascular safety based on route of administration:

**Transdermal estrogen** has consistently demonstrated lower risk compared to oral formulations for:
- Venous thromboembolism (RR ~0.5 vs oral)
- Ischemic stroke
- Myocardial infarction in high-risk women

The mechanism relates to avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism, with reduced effects on clotting factors, C-reactive protein, and triglycerides.

**Micronized progesterone** appears to have a more neutral cardiovascular profile compared to synthetic progestins, with some evidence suggesting better preservation of estrogen's beneficial vascular effects.

## THE FDA'S HISTORIC DECISION: NOVEMBER 2025

### Background and Context

For more than two decades, menopausal hormone therapy products carried prominent black box warnings—the FDA's strongest safety alert—cautioning about increased risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, stroke, and dementia. These warnings, instituted following the initial WHI results in 2002-2004, profoundly influenced clinical practice, leading to an estimated 66% decline in MHT prescriptions and leaving millions of women suffering with untreated menopausal symptoms.

### The Expert Panel and Review Process

On July 17, 2025, the FDA convened an expert panel to review the totality of evidence regarding MHT and cardiovascular risk. The panel examined:
- Long-term follow-up data from WHI, KEEPS, ELITE, and other trials
- Age-stratified and time-since-menopause analyses
- Real-world observational data from multiple countries
- Mechanistic studies of estrogen's vascular effects
- Contemporary prescribing patterns and formulations

Following the expert panel's recommendations and a public comment period, the FDA announced on November 10, 2025, its decision to remove black box warnings from all hormone therapy products.

### What Changed

The FDA is working with pharmaceutical companies to update labeling for four product classes:
1. Combined estrogen-progestogen products
2. Estrogen-alone products
3. Other estrogen-containing products
4. Progestogen-only products

**Key changes include:**
- Removal of black box warnings for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia
- **Retention** of the boxed warning for endometrial cancer risk with unopposed estrogen (for women with intact uteri)
- Addition of **age-specific guidance** indicating that women may benefit from MHT when initiated within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60
- Updated contraindications focusing on absolute rather than relative risks
- Clear differentiation between primary prevention (appropriate for some women) and use in those with established CVD (not recommended)

### Scientific Rationale

The FDA based its decision on several key findings:

1. **The original WHI warnings were based on a population with mean age 63 years**, not representative of typical MHT users
2. **Subsequent analyses demonstrated age-dependent effects**, with younger women showing benefit or neutral outcomes
3. **Absolute risk increases in the WHI were small** even in the older population
4. **The warnings had led to undertreatment** of severe menopausal symptoms, with negative impacts on quality of life
5. **Modern prescribing practices** emphasize transdermal formulations, lower doses, and bioidentical hormones with potentially better safety profiles

The FDA acknowledged that the black box warnings, while well-intentioned, had created a "chilling effect" that went beyond the evidence and prevented appropriate, individualized decision-making.

### Implementation Timeline

The label changes are expected to be implemented within six months of the November 2025 announcement, with updated prescribing information available by spring 2026.

## CONTEMPORARY EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS (2026)

Based on the accumulated evidence of the past decade and the FDA's recent decision, we offer the following updated recommendations:

### For Symptomatic Women Within 10 Years of Menopause or <60 Years Old

**Primary Recommendation:**
MHT is appropriate and effective for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms and should not be withheld due to cardiovascular concerns in low-risk women. For these women, MHT represents the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms and, when used appropriately, does not increase—and may reduce—cardiovascular risk.

**Preferred Regimens:**
- **First-line:** Transdermal 17β-estradiol at the lowest effective dose (typically 0.025-0.05 mg/day)
- **For women with intact uterus:** Add micronized progesterone 200 mg nightly or cyclic (12-14 days/month)
- **Alternative:** Low-dose oral estradiol (0.5-1 mg/day) if transdermal not tolerated
- **Avoid:** Oral conjugated equine estrogens in women with elevated triglycerides or VTE risk

**Duration:**
- Continue as long as symptoms persist and benefits outweigh risks
- Re-evaluate annually
- No arbitrary time limit for women who continue to benefit
- For women in whom MHT was initiated for symptoms and who remain asymptomatic, consider tapering after 5-7 years

### For Women >10 Years Post-Menopause or >60 Years Old

**General Recommendation:**
Do **not** initiate MHT solely for symptom management in this population without comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment.

**For Women with Severe Persistent Symptoms:**
- Perform thorough cardiovascular risk stratification
- Consider CAC scoring if available and not recently performed
- If low-intermediate risk (CAC 0-100, no ASCVD, ASCVD risk <10%): shared decision-making regarding MHT may be appropriate
- If high or very high risk: MHT is contraindicated; consider non-hormonal alternatives

**For Women Already on MHT:**
- If well-tolerated and providing benefit: continuation is reasonable in low-risk women
- Reassess cardiovascular risk annually
- Consider transdermal route if using oral formulations
- If cardiovascular risk factors accumulate: consider tapering/discontinuation

### Absolute Contraindications to MHT

Consistent with updated FDA guidance:
- Established cardiovascular disease (prior MI, stroke, TIA, revascularization)
- Active or history of VTE (DVT, PE) or known thrombophilia
- Active liver disease
- Estrogen-dependent malignancies (current or recent)
- Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding
- Pregnancy

### Special Considerations

**Premature or Early Menopause (<40 or <45 years):**
- MHT is **strongly recommended** until at least age 50 to mitigate long-term cardiovascular, bone, and cognitive risks
- Higher doses may be appropriate to replicate premenopausal levels
- Cardiovascular contraindications of typical MHT do not apply to this population

**Women with CVD Risk Factors but No Established Disease:**
- Individualized approach based on risk stratification
- Optimize management of risk factors (lipids, blood pressure, glucose, smoking cessation)
- Prefer transdermal estrogen
- Consider lower doses
- May still be appropriate candidates for MHT with shared decision-making

**Route Selection:**
Prefer **transdermal estrogen** in women with:
- Elevated triglycerides (>250 mg/dL)
- Obesity (BMI >30)
- Age >60 or >10 years post-menopause with persistent symptoms
- Diabetes
- History of gestational diabetes
- Migraine with aura

## AREAS OF ONGOING UNCERTAINTY AND FUTURE RESEARCH

Despite significant progress, important questions remain:

### 1. Optimal Duration of Therapy
While we now know that MHT can be safe long-term in appropriately selected women, the optimal duration for maximum benefit and minimal risk remains unclear. Do women who continue MHT for 15-20 years maintain cardiovascular benefits seen in younger users, or does prolonged exposure eventually increase risk even in those who started early?

### 2. Personalized Medicine Approaches
Can genetic polymorphisms in estrogen receptors, metabolic enzymes, or clotting factors identify women most likely to benefit or experience harm from MHT? Pharmacogenomic studies are ongoing but not yet ready for clinical application.

### 3. Cardiovascular Endpoints in Contemporary Formulations
Most trial data come from oral conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate. Do transdermal estradiol and micronized progesterone—now preferred formulations—show superior cardiovascular outcomes in long-term trials? A definitive trial using contemporary formulations in recently menopausal women with cardiovascular endpoints would be valuable but would require enormous sample sizes and costs.

### 4. Impact on Heart Failure
While coronary disease has received extensive attention, the relationship between MHT and heart failure—particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which predominantly affects postmenopausal women—requires further study.

### 5. Racial and Ethnic Differences
Most trial participants have been white women. Do the timing hypothesis and cardiovascular effects of MHT apply equally across racial and ethnic groups who may experience menopause differently and have varying baseline cardiovascular risk profiles?

## PARADIGM SHIFT: FROM FEAR TO INDIVIDUALIZED CARE

The past decade has witnessed a remarkable rehabilitation of hormone therapy for appropriately selected women. The pendulum has swung from the post-2002 era of near-universal avoidance to the current evidence-based, nuanced, individualized approach.

Several key principles have emerged:

1. **Timing is paramount:** The same intervention can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful depending on when it is initiated relative to menopause.

2. **MHT is not cardiovascular prevention:** We should not prescribe MHT solely to prevent heart disease. However, the presence of cardiovascular concerns should not automatically preclude MHT for symptom management in low-risk women.

3. **Route matters:** Transdermal estrogen appears safer than oral for most cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in higher-risk women.

4. **Individualization is essential:** One-size-fits-all recommendations—whether universally promoting or prohibiting MHT—do not serve women well. Comprehensive risk assessment and shared decision-making are required.

5. **Symptom burden matters:** Severe vasomotor symptoms are not merely quality-of-life issues; they are associated with cardiovascular risk and justify treatment.

The FDA's November 2025 decision to remove black box warnings represents official recognition of these principles and should enable more women to access appropriate symptom management without unwarranted fear.

## CLINICAL CASE SCENARIOS

To illustrate contemporary decision-making, we present three cases:

### Case 1: The Recently Menopausal Woman with Severe Symptoms
A 52-year-old woman presents 18 months after her last menstrual period with severe hot flashes (15-20/day), night sweats requiring bedding changes, and resulting sleep disruption. She has no significant medical history, normal BMI, no family history of premature CVD, blood pressure 118/72, LDL 105 mg/dL, fasting glucose 92 mg/dL. She is miserable and her quality of life is severely impacted.

**Recommendation:** This is an ideal candidate for MHT. Offer transdermal estradiol 0.05 mg/day with micronized progesterone 200 mg nightly. Counsel regarding expected benefits, minimal cardiovascular risk at her age and timing, and plan for annual reassessment. No arbitrary time limit; continue as long as benefits persist.

### Case 2: The Woman Remote from Menopause with Persistent Symptoms
A 64-year-old woman, 16 years post-menopause, presents with bothersome hot flashes that have never fully resolved. She was afraid to try MHT due to the old black box warnings. Medical history includes well-controlled hypertension (125/78 on one medication), BMI 28, LDL 115 mg/dL, no diabetes. She requests MHT now that the warnings have been removed.

**Recommendation:** This requires careful individualized assessment. Calculate 10-year ASCVD risk (likely 5-10% range = low-intermediate risk). If available, obtain CAC score. If CAC <100 and she understands the limitations of evidence in her age group, shared decision-making may support a trial of low-dose transdermal estradiol (0.025 mg/day) with micronized progesterone. Emphasize aggressive risk factor management. Consider non-hormonal alternatives as well (fezolinetant, paroxetine, gabapentin). If she develops cardiovascular disease or risk factors worsen, discontinue MHT.

### Case 3: The Woman with Established CVD
A 58-year-old woman, 6 years post-menopause, had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction 2 years ago, now with stents in place, on dual antiplatelet therapy, statin, and beta-blocker. She has severe vasomotor symptoms significantly impacting quality of life. She asks about MHT now that the "warnings are gone."

**Recommendation:** MHT remains **contraindicated** in established CVD regardless of the FDA label change. The removal of black box warnings does not mean MHT is safe for everyone; it means the warnings were overly broad for the general population. For this patient, recommend non-hormonal approaches: fezolinetant (neurokinin-3 receptor antagonist), paroxetine, gabapentin, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Optimize her cardiovascular medications and risk factors.

## CONCLUSION

Ten years after our initial review, we can state with confidence: the relationship between menopause, hormone therapy, and cardiovascular disease is complex, nuanced, and critically dependent on timing. The "timing hypothesis" has evolved from speculation to established clinical framework. The FDA's November 2025 decision to remove black box warnings from hormone therapy products represents the culmination of two decades of research refining our understanding and marks a new era in women's midlife health care.

For women within 10 years of menopause or under age 60 without contraindications, MHT remains the most effective treatment for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms and does not increase—and may reduce—cardiovascular risk. For women remote from menopause or with established cardiovascular disease, MHT is generally not appropriate, and alternative symptom management should be pursued.

As we move forward, the imperative is clear: individualized, evidence-based care that considers each woman's unique symptom burden, cardiovascular risk profile, personal preferences, and timing relative to menopause. The era of one-size-fits-all recommendations—whether universal promotion or prohibition—is over. The future of menopausal care is personalized medicine, and that future has arrived.
